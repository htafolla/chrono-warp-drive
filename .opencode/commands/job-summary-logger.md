# StrRay Framework - AI Summary Auto-Logger

# Automatically captures and logs whatever AI outputs as final summary

# 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: REFACTORING LOG IS APPEND-ONLY 🚨

#

# The REFACTORING_LOG.md file serves as an immutable audit trail of the project's evolution.

# This file must NEVER be edited or modified after creation - only NEW entries may be appended.

#

# ❌ NEVER edit existing entries

# ❌ NEVER delete entries

# ❌ NEVER reorder entries

# ❌ NEVER modify timestamps or content

#

# ✅ ONLY append new entries to the end

# ✅ ONLY add new information, never change old information

# ✅ ONLY use this automated logging system for consistency

#

# This ensures the refactoring log remains a reliable, immutable record of all changes.

# If you need to correct information, append a new entry documenting the correction.

#

# 🚨 VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE PROJECT'S HISTORICAL RECORD 🚨
